The purpose of this project was to gather data from the OOI website for the following CTD instruments:
• Oregon Shelf Surface Piercing Profiler Mooring
• Oregon Offshore Cabled Shallow Profiler Mooring
• Oregon Offshore Cabled Deep Profiler Mooring
• Oregon Slope Base Shallow Profiler
• Oregon Slope Base Deep Profiler
• Axial Base Shallow Profiler
• Axial Base Deep Profiler 

As well as answer the following questions:
" 
For each profiler data, and for 24 hours of data in bith winter and summer:
a. Compare the number of dives per day of the shallow profiler vs deep profiler
b. Where is the maximum value of ssp in each season? Explain why the max ssp should be there?
c. Compare the ssp profile in day and night of all profilers, explain what you find.
d. Compare the ssp profile in summer and winter of all profilers, explain what you find.
e. Compare the average ssp profiles of all profilers recorded at the same day in winter and summer.
"

I was able to complete M2M and basic graphing. But unable to complete the rest.
The graphs produced by the code however do show speed of sound vs depth, and depth vs time.
